\section{Explain Teleology}
Teleology is the notion that all things have a designated purpose, and that the
singular goal in life is to become something greater than you already are in an
effort to better fulfill your designated purpose.

Along with this notion of thinking comes the idea of "virtue". Being virtuous is
preforming your designated goal well. You are not virtuous is you "try but don't
succeed", you are only virtuous if you succeed.

For example, if a tree's designated purpose is to produce oxygen, then it
becomes virtuous by growing and providing more oxygen to its environment.

Additional topics include the golden mean, and the notion of happiness.
