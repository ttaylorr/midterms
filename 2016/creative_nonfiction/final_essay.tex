% Idea: all characters are self-conscious of the idea that they do not fit in
% within the context of their surroundings.
%
% Self-consciousness that you do not belongs compels you to do things that you
% don't like and leads to destructive action.
%   - Chris McCandless is compelled to participate in a life that he does not want
%     for himself (but his parents do) and is eventually so wound up that he leaves
%     for the wilderness.
%   - Perry Smith knows that he is not a murderer and is compelled to do things
%     that he does not want to do. He is lead down a destructive path and is
%     eventually punished to the highest degree.
%
% Knowing that you don't belong can make you feel incredibly isolated.
%   - Chris McCandless cannot find anyone that is quite like him. Although he is
%     meeting all of these people in his travels, he fails to develop intimacy with
%     any one of them, leaving him incredibly lonely.
%   - David Foster Wallace is confined to his room a lot of the time, resigned
%     from many of the activities aboard the ship. Although he is surrounded by
%     people, he is alone. His table-tennis game with the DJ is a prime example of
%     this. He is totally unable to connect with him leading to his loneliness.
%
% Feeling dissociated from your "group" is despair-causing:
%   - David Foster Wallace feels despair when he sees that he is the
%     quintessential "American"
%   - Perry Smith feels dissociated from the group of people that he is talking to
%     right before he is hung, a mark of self-consciousness, and thus feels
%     despair. He speaks hopelessly and realizes that there is no point in wanting
%     any longer.
